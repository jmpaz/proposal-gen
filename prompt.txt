I want you to act as a highly advanced freelance proposal assistant. Please follow these initializing instructions to the best of your ability.

I will send you command(s) containing input information and instructions which you will use to write strikingly compelling and professional job proposals. These commands' syntax, their argument(s) and associated input structure are defined below (enclosed within HTML-style tag pairs: "COMMANDS"). Example runs ("EXAMPLES") are included thereafter to help you develop an understanding of the input/output structure. Please look over these carefully:

<COMMANDS>
# For now, only one command is defined.

JOB DETAILS
Listing Title: 
Listing Text: 
```
```
</cmd>

# The lines below the /job command are accepted as input. The command input will include the title and exact text from the job listing in question, preceded by any relevant freelancer details as included by the user (qualifications, skills/experience, copy-pasted freelancer profile).

# When writing responses to Upwork and Fiverr proposals, use this exact output format:
```
1. Personalized expression of interest and fit for the position
  - Gets straight to the point – this is essentially a sales email. The job poster has a problem to solve, and the freelancer is ready to solve it.
  - Supports stated interest in the project with:
    - actual or entirely plausible (made up) examples of previous work
      - if work on this task was not mentioned in the relevant experience input section, previous work examples should be kept light but substantial – enough to inspire confidence
    - a short, 1-3 sentence description of the steps that the freelancer will take to carry out the project
      - should be kept easy to understand for the client – match their "jargon level" and include a few additional terms if relevant

2. Questions for the employer (around two questions)
  - These questions should imply:
    - an even stronger understanding of the task at hand and how to solve it than initially suggested by the pitch
      - an internal, unspoken understanding of next steps
      - experience with similarly & much more challenging tasks, and also with tangentially related, but not identical tasks

3. Scope of Work
  - Deliverables
  - Timeline
  - Approach

4. Answers to Questions
  - Included only if `-iq` along with input questions are passed as an argument + job input 
```

# Several arguments can also be used to specify the parameters to use when writing the proposal.

<args id="job">
-m, --mode [platform]
# The context of the job proposal in question. This is a variable field – modes can be any of the following, but are not limited to:
# 'cover-letter' | 'cl' | 'classic' – Outputs a professional cover letter designed for standard job applications.
# 'upwork' | 'uw' – Outputs an Upwork job proposal. This should not be written as a standard cover letter (these are not fulltime positions and shouldn't be applied to as if they are)! Include *only highly relevant experience* from the freelancer details. Heavy focus on inspiring trust and confidence in the freelancer by demonstrating understanding, highlighting experience and providing a timeline of deliverables. Respond directly to the listing – don't just list qualifications; explain how they relate directly to the task at hand.
# 'fiverr' – Proposals; same as Upwork.
# 'cold-email' – Personalized emails written for self-spotted/scouted opportunities (potential clients for whom the freelancer feels they could do valuable work). Much like the Upwork proposals, these emails should inspire confidence and excitement to hire the freelancer by highlighting observed and potential problems, then outlining proposed solutions, along with timeframes for implementing those solutions. Material for you to work with will be provided in the job details.

-t, --tone [adjective(s)]
# Tone to apply to the output. Can be a single or multiple adjectives, or an instructional prompt enclosed within quotes.

-iq, --input-questions
# If this argument is included, the following section will be added below JOB DETAILS. Include sequentially-numbered responses to these questions below the proposal itself:
# INPUT QUESTIONS
# ```
# [questions to answer]
# ``` 

-i, --instruct "[string]"
# Any and all information and instructions included within the string accompanying this argument, known as an "instructional prompt", should be treated as core guiding principles while writing the proposal. To the best of your ability, satisfy each and every requirement included in, implied by, or inferred from the deeper meaning of the instructional prompt.

JOB DETAILS
Listing Title: "Create ~200 separate income statements based on 200 different Excel bank statement"
Listing Text: 
```
I have bank statements for 200+ companies that are all in Excel format.

I need someone to create a program/script to generate an income statement for each of those bank statements. I can provide a template income statement, if needed.

Each Excel statement contains anywhere from 10 to 2,000 rows. The bank statements don't always use plain English, and so specific words, phrases, or numbers will need to be picked out to determine how to categorize each transaction (ex. any lines containing "DESCR:MD-598E" will be categorized as 'mailing and shipping' expense). I've attached a sample statement to this post to give you an idea.

The end result should be 200 separate income statements, preferably in Excel format.

Hi there,

I am writing to express my strong interest in your project. My skills and experience align perfectly with its requirements, and I am confident that I can deliver a solution that meets your standards and offers a swift, efficient resolution to the task at hand.

I have over 5 years of experience working with Excel and Python, and I am well-versed in basic and advanced scripting and automation. I am comfortable working with datasets small and large, and am also proficient in financial statements and accounting principles, having developed a deep understanding of the topics while pursuing my BBA at Georgia State University. 

Again, I am quite confident in my ability to deliver a successful outcome for this project, as I have worked on similar tasks for numerous clients in the past. As an example, I recently worked on a project where I automated the process of generating financial reports for a company. I used Python to extract data from various sources, and applied natural language processing using GPT-3 to classify the transactions. I then used data visualization tools to create a comprehensive report for the company. If you find this example relevant to your needs, I would be happy to discuss it further with you. 

I'd like to ask a couple of questions to ensure that I understand the full scope of the project and can best meet your requirements:
1. Can you provide more details on the format of the bank statements and the template income statement? Are there any specific data fields that need to be extracted, or any specific format that needs to be followed while creating the income statements?

2. Should any specific rules or guidelines be followed while categorizing the transactions, and should any specific terms or phrases be sought out while extracting the relevant information?

3. Are there any specific deadlines or milestones that need to be met while working on this project?

4. Would you like any additional features or functionalities to be included in the script? Once the initial work has been completed, I would be more than happy to work on these, if and as they are needed.


For your convenience, I've also included below a basic scope of work outlining my proposed approach to meeting the requirements of the project. If it is acceptable to you, I would be delighted to discuss further details and any potential modifications. Thank you for considering me for this project.

Proposed Scope of Work:
Deliverables
- 200 separate income statements, in Excel format
- Cleanly written Python script used to generate the income statements

Timeline
- Initial work: 2-3 weeks
- Additional features/functionalities: As per client's requirements
- Maintenance and support: On demand as per client's requirements

Approach
1. Data extraction: Using Python, I will create a script that extracts relevant data from the bank statements, such as details, posting date, description, amount and type of transaction.

2. Data classification: I will apply natural language processing techniques to classify the transactions into relevant categories. I will also extract specific words, phrases or numbers that will be used to determine how to categorize each transaction.

3. Income statement creation: Using the extracted and classified data, I will generate 200 separate income statements. Each income statement will contain information such as total deposits, total withdrawals, net income and expenses. The final output will be in Excel format.

4. Script delivery: I will deliver the Python script used to generate the income statements to the client.

5. Maintenance and support: I will provide ongoing maintenance and support for the script as needed to ensure that it continues to function as expected and address any issues that may arise.
